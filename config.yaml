  # Quality Filtering
  min_quality_score: 0.5           # Minimum overall quality (0.0-1.0)
  min_blur_score: 0.3              # Minimum sharpness
  min_size_score: 0.4              # Minimum face size

# Cross-Video Tracking Settings
cross_video:
  # Matching strategy

  clustering_algorithm: "dbscan"   # "dbscan" or "agglomerative"
  # Note: 0.92 means faces must be 92% similar to be grouped as same person
  # Lower values group more aggressively (more false grouping)
  # Higher values separate more (better for distinguishing different people)

  # Quality filtering
